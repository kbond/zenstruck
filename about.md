## Web Developer

> I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination.<br />-Albert Einstein

I am a self-taught web developer from Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.
I started programming when I was 12 years old and have been dreaming in code ever since.

*zenstruck* is sort of a play on words trying to capture an ideal I strive for when developing.
Simple, clean, yet powerful applications.  When all this comes together it is an amazing thing... leaving you zenstruck.

The idea of open source has really appealed to me. Recently I have been
utilizing and contributing to the [Symfony PHP framework][1]. I have helped the
community identify and fix bugs, contributed to feature enhancements and developed
several *plugins*. One of which ([sfAdminDashPlugin][2]) is currently the 8th most popular out of
over 1000 published.  Symfony was my first encounter with an open source community and since
then I have come to greatly respect many other open source projects.

Some other open source tools I use:

* [NetBeans][3] - Cross-platform IDE I use for *everything*
* [wampserver][4] - Windows based web server package (apache/mysql/php)
* [jQuery][5] - My favorite javascript framework
* [Ubuntu][6] - I do some things in Linux and love this distro
* <del>[subversion][7] / [tortoiseSvn][8]  - for source control</del>
* [git][9] / [tortoiseGit][10] (client)  - for **better** source control
* [GitHub][11] - for *social coding*

### My skill set:

* XHTML/CSS web standards compliant web sites
* MySQL database development
* PHP web development including knowledge of the [Symfony][1] and [Zend][12] frameworks
* Webserver administration
* Ajax / Javascript client side scripting including knowledge of the [jQuery][5] framework
* Web service development with experience utilizing Google, Facebook, Flickr and Twitter developer API's

I created this website to consolidate all of my projects and to establish a portfolio.
